## PR-via-SDP

This repository contains a Python implementation of (a modification of) the phase retrieval algorithm proposed in the article [Gabor phase retrieval via semidefinite programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-024-09683-6) authored by Philippe Jaming and myself, which has been published in **Foundations of Computational Mathematics**.

The phase retrieval problem is solved by essentially solving a convex optimization problem and a simple eigenvalue problem. For more details, check out the linked article.

Run the file **phaserec_test.py** to see how the reconstruction scheme performs on randomly generated data.
