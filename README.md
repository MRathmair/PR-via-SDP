## PR-via-SDP

This repository contains the Python implementation of the phase retrieval algorithm proposed in the article [Gabor phase retrieval via semidefinite programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-024-09683-6) authored by Philippe Jaming and myself, which has been published in **Foundations of Computational Mathematics**.

Run the file **phaserec_test.py** to see how the reconstruction scheme performs on randomly generated data.
